Test dataset of four samples consisting of reads simulated based on the virus_lambda.fa reference sequence.

Reads were simulated using the simulate.pl script provided with the Bowtie2 distribution; the reference also came from that package.

Within each sample folder are uniquely named readsX.bam and varX.flt.vcf files where X is the sample number.

There are also non-unique reads.bam and var.flt.vcf files in each folder.
