Notes:
20140310-har: To run snp pipeline code with Jamie agona example, I did the following:
  1. ln -s /home/hugh.rand/mnt /Volumes
  2. cd /Volumes/gnome/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased
  3. #little one
     python 4snplist_matrix_P_02262014.py -n 1 -d /Volumes/gnome/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -r NC_011149.fasta -f pathsToBamTest.txt
     #big one
     python 4snplist_matrix_P_02262014.py -n 1 -d /Volumes/gnome/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -r NC_011149.fasta -f pathsToBamTest.txt
20130310-har: To run snp pipline code with simple virus example, do:
  1. cd ~/projects/snppipeline/snppipeline/
  2. python snppipelinenew.py -n 10 -d ~/projects/snppipeline/test/testForOriginalCode/ -f path.txt -r lambda_virus.fa -l snplist.txt -a snpma.fasta
20130310-har: As well, to run with old code with simple virus example, do:
  2. python 4snplist_matrix_P_01022014.py -n 10 -d ~/projects/snppipeline/test/testForOriginalCode/ -f path.txt -r lambda_virus.fa -l snplist.txt -a snpma.fasta
20130310-har: As well, to run with Yan's new code with simple virus example, do:
  2. python 4snplist_matrix_P_02262014.py -n 10 -d ~/projects/snppipeline/test/testForOriginalCode/ -f path.txt -r lambda_virus.fa -l snplist.txt -a snpma.fasta
20140313-har: Jamie found a problem comparing the current code to the old code. I think
  this is not picked up in the current test becuase there are no gaps in it and the
  problem is with the handling of gaps. Currently, I can compare the following runs
  and get different results:
    ./snppipelinenew.py -n 10 -d /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -f pathsToBamYanForHugh.txt -r NC_011149.fasta -l Agona_127_SNPlistYan -a Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCode.fa
    python 4snplist_matrix_P_02262014.py -n 10 -d /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -f pathsToBamYanForHugh.txt -r NC_011149.fasta -l Agona_127_SNPlistYan -a Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCode.fa
    diff /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCode.fa /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCode.fa
  These runs take too long, so I need to make a shorter test case and try it. Make file
  with fewer samples:
    /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/pathsToBamYanForHughShort.txt
  Try running this one:
    ./snppipelinenew.py -n 1 -d /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -f pathsToBamYanForHughShort.txt -r NC_011149.fasta -l Agona_127_SNPlistYan -a Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCodeShort.fa
    python 4snplist_matrix_P_02262014.py -n 10 -d /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -f pathsToBamYanForHughShort.txt -r NC_011149.fasta -l Agona_127_SNPlistYan -a Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCodeShort.fa
    diff /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCodeShort.fa /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCodeShort.fa
  Hmm... With this shorter case, I don't get a difference. Time to look more carefully
    at the differences.
  Having looked at the differences, it is not just gaps. Hmm... Not too clear
    what the problem is.
20140313-har: Let's think about this.
  Each run of the code produces:
    1. List of SNPs for all samples (the -l flag argument).
    2. A fasta file of the SNPs.
  We now have 4 runs (my code vs. yan, full vs. short case). How do these files compare? Well,
    first let us make a list of them:
      List of SNPs file         
        my code   short           Agona_127_SNPlistYanFullHughShort
        yan       short           Agona_127_SNPlistYanFullShort
        my code   full            Agona_127_SNPlistYanFullHugh
        yan       full            Agona_127_SNPlistYanFull
      Fasta file
        my code   short           Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCodeShort.fa
        yan       short           Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCodeShort.fa
        my code   full            Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCode.fa
        yan       full            Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithYanCode.fa
  We didn't keep all these, so time to re-run and create them.
    ./snppipelinenew.py -n 14 -d /home/hugh.rand/mnt/gnome3/Papers/AgonaMOM/ReferenceBased/ -f pathsToBamYanForHughShort.txt -r NC_011149.fasta -l Agona_127_SNPlistYanFullHughShort -a Agona_127_SNPmaYanWithHughCodeShort.fa
