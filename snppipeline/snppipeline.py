    """Create SNP matrix
     
    Description:
    Create a SNP matrix. This function expects, or creates '(*)', the following
        files arranged in the following way:
            mainPath            
                reference.fasta
                path.txt
                snplist.txt (*)
                snpma.fasta (*)
            samples
                sample_name_one/reads.bam
                sample_name_one/reads.pileup (*)
                sample_name_one/var.flt.vcf
                ...
  
    The files are used as follows:
        1. The reference.fasta file is used for alignment of the sequence
            data in the running of the samtools pileup.
        2. The path.txt file contains a list of the paths to the sample
            directories.
        3. The snplist.txt file contains the list of SNPs extracted from the
            var.flt.vcf file.            
        4. The snpma.fasta file contains the SNP calls for each sequence,
            arranged as a fasta file with one sequence per sample.
        5. The reads.bam file is used by the samtools pileup program to
            generate the pileup files for each sequence.
        6. The reads.pileup files are used to determine the nucleotide base at
            each SNP position for each sample to construct the SNP fasta file.
        7. The variant file var.flt.vcf is used to construct the SNP position
            list. 
    
    The samtool pileups are run in parallel using the python multiprocessing
        package.
    
    The vcf and bam files are created outside of this function. The package
        documentation provides an example of creating these files based on the
        lambda_virus sequence that is use as one test for this package.
        
    Args:
        maxThread: (15) Max number of cocurrent threads.
        mainPath:  (no default) Directory containing all input files. Output
            files will also be written here.
        Reference: (no default) File name for reference sequence (in fasta
            format) for mapping.
        pathFileName: ("path.txt") Name of file containing full paths to
            directories containing information for each sequence.
        snplistFileName: Text format list of SNP positions in samples.
        snpmaFileName: File name for snp matrix, formatted as a fasta file,
            with each sequence (all of identical length) corresponding to the
            SNPs in the correspondingly named sequence.
        bamFileName: #TODO 
        pileupFileName: Name for pileup files. One is generated for each
            sample, and placed in the corresponding directory for each sample.
        DP: Combined depth across samples.
        AF1: Allele frequency for first allele.
        AR: AR flag value.
